### Design

The following technologies are used in this project:

* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) which is a superset of Javascript that adds optional type annotations and class based OOP to the language.
* [Microbundle](https://github.com/developit/microbundle). Microbundle is a zero-configuration bundler for small libraries and web components. It is used to package and distribute your code in a format that can be used in different environments
* [isomporhic-unfetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/isomorphic-unfetch). It's a library that implements the browsers's Fetch API to be used on both client and server. This library allows you to make HTTP requests in a way that is consistent across both client and server-side Javascript
